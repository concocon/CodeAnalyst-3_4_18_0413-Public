* RELEASE NOTES * 
*****************

CodeAnalyst requires minor modifications to the OProfile kernel 
module in order to add supports for latest processors and additional
features.  

The modification mainly adds supports for: 
    - Port CA_CSS
    - Port CA_MUX
    - Port Errata for workarounds
    - Add family15h_1xh (TN) supports
    - Fix ctr_running race condition (with Robert's patch)
    - Fix CSS crash due to NMI race condition when copy_from_user_inatomic
    - Add OR workaround to clear the IbsOpData3 MSR after reading
    - Add supports for kernel 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.2.0

This driver comes from linux-2.6.38-7 source and has been modified
to be compatible with the following kernels:
    - N/A

****************
* INSTALLATION *
****************

NOTE: Perform following steps as "root":

1) Check the kernel by running "uname -r" and check make sure the running
   kernel is based on supported kernels in the above list
	

2) Some Linux distributions might require kernel source package
   is installed.


3) Make sure the GCC C/C++ compiler package is installed.


4) In this directory, run "make" to build the kernel module. 
   This will create the kernel module file called "oprofile.ko".


5) [Optional] Please save the original oprofile.ko file. It is located at, 
    
	"/lib/module/`uname -r`/kernel/arch/x86/oprofile/oprofile.ko" 


6) Run "make install" to install the previously created "oprofile.ko" 
   to the proper kernel module directory.

   NOTE: "make install" first back up the original "oprofile.ko" to 
         "oprofile.ko.orig" before replace it with the newly buid driver.
         "make uninstall" should restore the original driver 
         (from "oprofile.ko.orig".

7) [Optional] Some distributions (i.e. SLES11 )require 
   "allow_unsupported_modules" variable (in file /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules") 
   set to 1 in order to load the driver.


8) Please reload the new kernel module by 
	opcontrol --deinit" 
	opcontrol --init" 
   or
	rebooting the sytem
