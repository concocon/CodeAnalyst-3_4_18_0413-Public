OVERVIEW
========
This library provides interfaces for creating and accessing CodeAnalyst profile 
data file (TBP/EBP/IMD file).  Besides, it provides a collection of profile data 
containers which CodeAnalyst uses for various types of data aggregation.


TBPVER_10
==========
Current library supports TBPVER_10. It is backward compatible from TBPVER_6.
In TBPVER_10, the profile data is separated into two types of file.

* TBP/EBP (Time-Based Profile/ Event-Based Profile File)
    - TBPFILEVERSION:
    This is the version identification string.

    - [ENV] Section
    This section contains metadata of the profile.
        * CPU		: Number of cpus
        * NumEvents	: Number of events
        * MODULES	: Number of modules
        * SAMPS		: Number of samples
        * TIMESTAMP	: Profile timestamp string (i.e. Sat May 15 06:12:40 2010)
        * MISSED	: Number of sample Missed (not currently used)
        * CPUFAMILY	: Cpu models and family (i.e. 16,9)
        * Event		: Each event (i.e. 0,118,100000) (There could be multiple entry.)

    - [PROCESS] Section
    This section contains a list of processes.
        * Process line format: PID,TOTALSAMPLE,#EVENTSET,[CPU INDEX] #SAMPLE,32-BIT-FLAG,CSS-FLAG,MODULE-NAME

    - [MODDATA] Section
    This section contains a list of modules
        * Module Line format: PID,TOTALSAMPLE,#EVENTSET,[CPU INDEX] #SAMPLE,32-BIT-FLAG,MODULE-NAME


* IMD (Individual Module Data)File

    - Naming Scheme:
         <Session Name>.<extension>.<index>.imd
         The index is assigned using the order of the module listed in the [MODDATA] section of TBP/EBP file.

    - Headers
        * [C:\Users\ssuthiku\Desktop\scimark2_C\Scimark_C_VS05.exe]
        * SIZE		: Not currently used
        * SAMPS		: Number of samples in the modules
        * ModuleType	: Module type
        * NUMSUBSECTIONS: Number of sub-sections

    - [SUB] Section	:
        * BINARYFILE	: Jnc file name
        * SRCFILE	: Java/Managed source file
        * SYMBOL	: Java/Managed function symbol
        * BASEADDR	: Module base address
        * INSTANCE	: Each of Java Inline instances (i.e. Addr:NumInstances:Symbol) (There could be multiple entry.)        
        * LINECOUNT	: Number of sample line
        * Sample Line Format: TGID,TID,TOTALSAMPLE,#EVENTSET,[CPU INDEX] #SAMPLE,OFFSET


EXPORT READER/WRITER CLASSES
============================

* class CaProfileReader
    Headers	: CaProfileReader.h
    Description	: CaProfileReader is used to query information from various 
                  sections of TBP/EBP and IMD files.

* class CaProfileWriter
    Headers	: CaProfileWriter.h
    Description	: CaProfileWrite is used to write TBP/EBP and IMD files


EXPORT CONTAINER CLASSES AND DATASTRUCTURES
===========================================

* SampleKey		: A class representing a key containing "cpu" and "event"
* CA_SampleMap		: std::map<SampleKey, unsigned long>

* AptKey		: A class representing a key containing "Address", "Pid" and "Tid"
* AggregatedSample	: A class for managing CA_SampleMap 
* AptAggregatedSampleMap	: A map of type <AptKey, AggregatedSample> (used in CA_Function)
* PidAggregatedSampleMap	: A map of type <pid, AggregatedSample> (used in CA_Module)

* CA_Process 		: A class representing each line of the process section
* PidProcessMap		: A map representing the process section which use PID as the key

* CA_Module		: A class representing each line of the module section
* NameModuleMap		: A map representing the module section which uses name as the key

* CA_Function		: A class representing each sub section in the IMD file
* AddrFunctionMultMap	: A multi-map representing the [SUB] section which uses base address as the key
			  Note: Functions could be rejitted in the same address
